The #8 is always packed in the morning from 7:30AM up until 10 AM. After that, your odds of finding a seat dramatically increase. Not pictured: (left) a hipster store that only sells limited edition hats.
My family and I used to stand on this platform for a fun day trip downtown. Now I stand on this platform for a boring day at school, a grueling day at work or sometimes, both!
Even though daylight savings was over a month ago, its still jarring to see daylight when class is over at 6:45. I still expect a dark, snowy sky lit with yellow orange street lights.
Post 150 iced coffee. Their first mistake was not mentioning this was a summer only promotion. Their last mistake was letting me through the doors.
The train home isn't packed tonight. Tonight, there's a trumpet player. Better than the wannabe rappers, but not as great as the quartet or that dap dancing old man.
Looking down Argyle. 
The view of a CTA turnstile when you've got a boring morning at work ahead of you, followed by a frustrating afternoon at school and then a long commute home in the evening. Ugh!
The insides of one of the many parking garages in downtown Chicago. This one is for receiving shipments and making disgruntled workers throw out their department's heavy, messy garbage.
Our produce department before the chinese fire drill that is the afternoon and evening rush. You can't even tell that it was in disarray a few hours ago, or that it'll be pure anarchy in another few hours.
Threats of a visit from corporate has us ARGO-ing the shelves. In the Great Gatsby, theres this part where the main character sees a line of people bringing boxes of orange crates into Gatsby's house for juice. I thought that was a cool image. Little did I know it would become a horrifying reality.
The old magnetic strip cards had more AESTHETIC than these ventra ones. They came in different flavors and you had to reload them in this big machine that made the most satisfying beep when you completed the transaction! 
One time, I had to go to work one New Year's Day. The bus driver was in a super good mood. He gave everyone on the route a free ride (despite the cutoff having been ~2 hours ago) and stopped right in front of this gas station for coffee and a newspaper. He was so excited, he unironically asked us if we wanted anything too! Unreal!
A long time ago, my mom and I used to wait for bus to go work/preschool. We used to see this other man who commuted to work too. Sometimes I'd get nervous and hide inside my mom's blue jacket. I found that jacket a few years ago and tried it on for kicks. It didn't fit.
Years ago, when this concrete was freshly poured, my brother, sister and I huddled around it and started messing around with it. I saw one of them make a soft imprint with their shoe and wanted to do the same, but I ended up losing my balance and smashing my adidas into the soft concrete. I got really upset because I was told that I ruined the whole neighborhood, but now that I think back, it was actually pretty funny.
This is where I "practice" skateboarding on the occasional Tuesday/Thursday evening. Its mostly quiet, has a great view of the sunset and is free of skateboard hating dogs. I never noticed how slopey and smooth the asphalt was until last Thanksgiving when I skated through and saw two people either fighting (or talking very loudly) in front of a nice sunset.     
Nice picture of a clear blue sky and the moon. Just in case a bunch of condos spring up around here one day and blot out the sun.
I always get nervous skating around people because I feel that I'll either crash into them or that I'll trip on a pebble and fall on someone (its happened before on the bus and train). If I don't get a chance to skate at school, I get off the bus at this street and skate home. Back in high school, my brother also tried to teach me to drive stick down this street. The keyword is tried. Eventually he raged quit and we went back home, where I got to keep play Rollercoaster Tycoon. 
The airplanes were particularly loud tonight.
De regreso del veterinario
Rumbo al trabajo, cuando los niños no van a la escuela
The switching sign at the Kimball Brown Line terminal! Its like something out of a movie! Too bad you always have to move fast through here, otherwise you're stuck waiting 7+ minutes for the next train,
When I was little, my mom used to always take me to this clinic on Belmont. I always knew it was Belmont because of this sign. Before they remodeled the entire station, the graffiti marked sheet was actually a window showcasing cool leather jackets and weird clothes (probably from The Alley). I'm pretty sure that ticket master sign was always faded. Not pictured: this huge sign for a seedy arcade that said Dennis'. They painted a boy in an admiral suit on the sign. The face perfectly fit the name.
Before I understood what train routes were, I always kept an eye out for the garage in the background. Passing it meant one of two things would happen: 1. we'd take a scenic trip on the elevated tracks or 2. we'd take a loud, terrifying trip through the subway. It was usually the subway.
I heard that Chicago's EL tracks were purposely mapped to go the city's alleys. Here is a perfect example! Listen to the upbeat morning train conductor address the passengers.
Pictured: anarchy at the North and Halsted bus stop. Usually, people line up against the wall of the apple store to wait for the bus, but not today.
I always liked this view of the skyline. Its close enough to see all the detail, but far enough to seem unreal. Like someone pain-stakingly cut out all buildings from paper.
Pictured: all the equipment we've ever used in our ECE labs. Almost like a a "best of" gallery. Not pictured: my friend and I fighting about our senior design project.
They gave us back our quizzes in ECE 317. My friend got zero points for the first question. The TA literally wrote "zero" and circled it! WEW
Trying to pay attention in ECE 317. The Sandman's game is strong.
This bar is strategically located between the monument to the revolution and government offices -- a common route for protesters to march along. Besides the name and relatively expensive menu prices, the wait staff are dressed like local anti riot police which makes this place all too ironic.
This is one of the busiest avenues in Mexico City where you can see a beautiful art deco building in one corner and more modern skyscrapers on the opposite side.
This is a common destination for tourists visiting Mexico City but for me it's halfway between my office and my gym.
This is a historic landmark for both locals and tourists but I see it every day when I walk home and use it as a reference point to guide visitors.
This apartment is only a block away from home, but it used to feel like it was so far away. My mom used to say that there was this big dog in one of the windows. After seeing me panic, she told me that she meant she saw a big plush dog. Still can't see it.
Waiting for the #92 bus to complete the last leg of my trip home. Not pictured: the Judge Dredd comics I used to read on the way home, all the homework assignments I brainstormed through here, the recipe that won me 5 dragon dollars from the Wellness Center recipe contest.
Messing around in the senior design lab. Just wanted to use the oscilloscope one last time.
This used to be busiest corner in the world.
The street corner where Julian Ralph marveled at the crowds, skyscrapers, electricity and elevators back in 1892. He said this corner used to make New York City's Broadway look completely empty!
I was walking towards Adams/Wabash station one day when I heard Rebel Rebel playing through low quality speakers amongst the usual sound of rushing trains and honking cars. The music ended up coming from here! Eventually came back for their spicy gyro and cheese fires. This place must have also made an impression on my brother because he was telling me about it several months later!
My brother and sister used to hang out with all their friends in this alley.
